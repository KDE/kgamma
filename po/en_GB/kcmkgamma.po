"<h1>Monitor Gamma</h1> This is a tool for changing monitor gamma correction. "
"Use the four sliders to define the gamma correction either as a single "
"value, or separately for the red, green and blue components. You may need to "
"correct the brightness and contrast settings of your monitor for good "
"results. The test images help you to find proper settings.<br> You can save "
"them system-wide to XF86Config (root access is required for that) or to your "
"own KDE settings. On multi head systems you can correct the gamma values "
"separately for all screens."
